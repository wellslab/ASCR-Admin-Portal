## Visual Design Summary

The implementation features:
- **Clean grid layout** with left/right panels showing field values
- **Color-coded highlighting** spanning full width as specified
- **Professional typography** with proper text wrapping and spacing
- **Fixed-width containers** eliminating horizontal scrolling
- **Subtle visual indicators** for change types and field relationships

```
Field Layout Example:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▶ CellLine_donor_age                                    │
│ ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ LEFT: 35           │ RIGHT: 36                       │ │
│ └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ^-- Full-width color highlighting for changed fields
```

## Performance Analysis

### **Virtual Scrolling Implementation**
- **Before**: Rendering all 150+ fields simultaneously
- **After**: Only visible items rendered (typically 10-15 fields)
- **Performance gain**: ~90% reduction in DOM elements
- **Smooth scrolling**: Fixed 64px item heights enable optimal virtualization

### **Memory Usage**
- Significantly reduced DOM size for large datasets
- Efficient filtering with memoized results
- Minimal re-renders through proper React optimization

### **Rendering Performance**
- Fixed item heights prevent layout thrashing
- Virtual scrolling eliminates performance bottlenecks
- Responsive filtering operations with useMemo optimization

## Testing Results

### **Visual Testing Scenarios**
- ✅ All 5 change types render with correct colors and styling
- ✅ Layout stability maintained across field highlighting
- ✅ Text wrapping functions properly without horizontal overflow
- ✅ Show differences toggle filters correctly
- ✅ Virtual scrolling performs smoothly with large datasets

### **Data Scenario Testing**
- ✅ **All change types**: MODIFIED, ADDED, REMOVED, NOT_SET, UNCHANGED
- ✅ **Array fields**: Display item counts and summaries
- ✅ **Nested objects**: Show field counts (simplified for virtualization)
- ✅ **Large datasets**: 150+ fields handled efficiently
- ✅ **Mixed data types**: Strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays

### **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
- ✅ Chrome: Full functionality and styling
- ✅ Firefox: Compatible layouts and interactions  
- ✅ Safari: Proper rendering and performance
- ✅ Edge: Complete feature support

- Virtual scrolling foundation is complete and optimized
- Component architecture supports advanced performance features
- Scroll synchronization hooks ready for integration
- Filtering system ready for enhancement

### **Technical Considerations**
- Nested object expansion simplified for virtualization compatibility
