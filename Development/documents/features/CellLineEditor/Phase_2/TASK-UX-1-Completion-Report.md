- ✅ Visual feedback immediate for all control interactions
- ✅ Layout remains stable during loading/data changes
- ✅ Professional appearance consistent with existing components
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces defined for all state and props
- ✅ Proper error boundaries and loading state handling
- ✅ Clean component structure ready for diff integration
- ✅ Performance optimized (no unnecessary re-renders)

## Implementation Summary

Successfully created a complete side-by-side version control layout positioned above the editor interface as requested. The implementation includes:

### **New Components Created:**

**1. `VersionSelector.tsx`**
- Reusable dropdown component with search functionality
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and error handling
- Consistent styling with existing design patterns
- Loading states and disabled state support

**2. `VersionControlLayout.tsx`**
- Main side-by-side layout with 50/50 panel split
- Four dropdown selectors (left/right cell line and version)
- Header controls: Lock/unlock toggle and show differences toggle
- Complete state management with TypeScript interfaces
- API integration for cell lines and versions endpoints
- Error handling and loading states
- Proper visual feedback for all interactions

### **Integration Points:**
- Added to `EditorContainer.tsx` positioned above the existing editor
- Imports existing `useCellLineData` hook for cell line data
- Ready for integration with future diff rendering components

## Technical Implementation Details

### **State Management:**
```typescript
interface VersionControlState {
  leftCellLine: string | null;
  leftVersion: string | null;
  rightCellLine: string | null;
  rightVersion: string | null;
  isScrollLocked: boolean;
  showDifferencesOnly: boolean;
  isLoading: {
    leftPanel: boolean;
    rightPanel: boolean;
  };
}
```

### **API Integration:**
- `GET /api/editor/celllines/` - Cell line options (121 cell lines available)
- `GET /api/editor/celllines/{id}/versions/` - Version lists
- `GET /api/editor/celllines/{id}/versions/{number}/` - Specific version data

### **Component Architecture:**
- Positioned above editor interface as requested
- Professional styling matching existing design system
- Responsive layout with proper visual hierarchy
- Event-driven state management with callback props

## Testing Results

### **API Integration Testing:**
- ✅ Cell lines endpoint: Successfully returns 121 cell lines
- ✅ Version history endpoint: Returns proper version data (15 versions tested)
- ✅ Specific version endpoint: Returns complete metadata structure
- ✅ All API responses match expected component interface

### **Build Testing:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (no errors in new components)
- ✅ Frontend container builds and runs successfully
- ✅ Full application stack operational in Docker
- ✅ No linting errors introduced by new components

### **Component Functionality:**
- ✅ Version control interface positioned correctly above editor
- ✅ Professional styling consistent with existing components
- ✅ Responsive layout with proper visual hierarchy
- ✅ All control elements functional with proper visual feedback
- ✅ Dropdown search functionality working properly
- ✅ Loading states appear during API calls
- ✅ Error handling displays user-friendly messages

## Issues & Resolutions

**Issue**: TypeScript linting errors with `any` types  
**Resolution**: Replaced `any` types with `unknown` for better type safety

**Issue**: Docker environment requirement  
**Resolution**: Used proper `docker-compose exec` commands for all testing

**Issue**: Integration with existing EditorContainer layout  
**Resolution**: Positioned component above existing editor interface, maintaining separation of concerns

## Files Created/Modified

### **New Files:**
- `api/front-end/my-app/src/app/tools/editor/components/VersionSelector.tsx`
- `api/front-end/my-app/src/app/tools/editor/components/VersionControlLayout.tsx`

### **Modified Files:**
- `api/front-end/my-app/src/app/tools/editor/components/EditorContainer.tsx`
  - Added import for `VersionControlLayout`
  - Positioned component above main content area
  - Added proper border separation

## Integration Specifications for TASK-UX-2

### **Ready Integration Points:**
- `onComparisonReady` callback provides structured data for diff rendering
- Panel containers prepared with consistent styling
- State flags available: `isScrollLocked`, `showDifferencesOnly`
- Loading states implemented for smooth transition to diff display

### **Data Flow:**
```typescript
// When both versions are selected, callback fires with:
onComparisonReady(leftVersionData, rightVersionData)

// Data structure includes complete cell line metadata:
{
  CellLine_hpscreg_id: string,
  // ... all 150+ fields for comparison
}
```

### **Component Integration:**
- Replace placeholder panel content with diff rendering components
- Utilize existing loading states for diff processing
- Leverage scroll lock state for synchronized scrolling implementation

## Performance Characteristics

- **Dropdown Search**: Instant filtering with debounced API calls
- **State Management**: Optimized with useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **API Calls**: Cached version data per cell line
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal state footprint with cleanup on component unmount

## Next Steps for TASK-UX-2

1. **Diff Rendering Integration**: Replace panel placeholders with actual diff components
2. **Synchronized Scrolling**: Implement scroll lock functionality
3. **Field Filtering**: Utilize `showDifferencesOnly` state for diff display modes
4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider virtualization for large diff displays

## Quality Assurance

- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable TypeScript with proper interfaces
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface following existing design patterns
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with minimal unnecessary operations
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback

**System Status**: ✅ Stable and ready for TASK-UX-2 integration
