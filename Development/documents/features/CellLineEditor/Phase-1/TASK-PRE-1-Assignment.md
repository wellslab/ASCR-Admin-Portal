# TASK ASSIGNMENT: PRE-1 - Verify Database Migration Completion

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-PRE-1  
**Assignee**: Backend Agent  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day  
**Priority**: Critical (Blocks all other development)  
**Dependencies**: None  

## Project Context

You are working on the **CellLineEditor Phase 1** implementation for the ASCR Web Services project. This is a Django + Next.js application that manages stem cell research data. The CellLineEditor will allow researchers to edit complex JSON-structured cell line metadata (150+ fields per cell line) through an intuitive web interface.

**Repository**: `/Users/StefanMacbook/Documents/research-project/ascr-web-services`  
**Tech Stack**: Django backend, PostgreSQL database, Next.js frontend  
**Scale**: 300-3000 cell line records expected  

## Task Description

**CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**: Before any CellLineEditor development can begin, we must verify that cell line data has been successfully migrated from the filesystem to the database. Previous development phases were supposed to complete this migration, but we need confirmation before proceeding.

## Your Mission

Investigate the current state of cell line data storage and verify the migration is complete and functional. If issues are found, document them clearly for resolution.

## Technical Requirements

### What You Need to Check

1. **Database Structure Verification**
   - Confirm cell line tables exist in the database
   - Verify JSON data storage is properly configured
   - Check that indexes are in place for performance

2. **Data Migration Verification**
   - Confirm cell line JSON files are no longer stored on filesystem
   - Verify all cell line data is accessible via Django ORM
   - Ensure no data was lost during migration

3. **Performance Validation**
   - Test query performance for listing cell lines
   - Verify search operations perform acceptably
   - Confirm the system can handle 300-3000 records efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria

Your task is complete when ALL of the following are verified and documented:

- [ ] **Database Tables Exist**: Cell line data tables are present in the database
- [ ] **JSON Storage Functional**: Cell line metadata is stored as JSON and accessible
- [ ] **Migration Complete**: No cell line JSON files remain on filesystem
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: All expected cell line records are present in database
- [ ] **ORM Access**: Cell line data can be queried using Django ORM
- [ ] **Performance Acceptable**: List/search operations complete in reasonable time
- [ ] **Issues Documented**: Any problems found are clearly documented with solutions

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Investigation
```bash
# Access Django shell to inspect database
python manage.py shell

# Check what models exist
from django.apps import apps
apps.get_models()

# Look for cell line related tables
from django.db import connection
connection.introspection.table_names()
```

### Step 2: Data Verification
```python
# In Django shell, check for cell line data
# Look for existing models that might store cell line data
# Check if JSON data is present and properly formatted

# Example queries to run:
# - Count total cell line records
# - Sample a few records to verify structure
# - Check for required fields like hpscreg_id
```

### Step 3: Performance Testing
```python
# Test query performance with timing
import time

# Test listing operations
start = time.time()
# Run list query
end = time.time()
print(f"List query took: {end - start} seconds")

# Test search operations if applicable
# Document response times
```

### Step 4: Filesystem Check
```bash
# Check if old JSON files still exist
find . -name "*.json" -type f | grep -i cell
find . -name "*cell*" -type d

# Document what you find
```

## Expected Data Structure

Based on the project requirements, cell line data should include:
- **hpscreg_id**: Unique identifier (primary key)
- **metadata**: JSON field containing 150+ fields including:
  - donor_information (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.)
  - culture_conditions (arrays of culture data)
  - characterization data
  - genetic information
  - And many more nested fields

## Deliverables

Create a comprehensive report documenting your findings:

### 1. Migration Status Report
Create: `documents/features/CellLineEditor/Migration-Status-Report.md`

Include:
- Current database structure
- Sample data verification
- Performance test results
- Any issues discovered
- Recommendations for next steps

### 2. Code Examples
If you write any test scripts or queries, save them as:
`documents/features/CellLineEditor/migration-verification-scripts.py`

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### If Migration is Incomplete:
- **Issue**: Cell line tables don't exist
- **Action**: Document the missing infrastructure and recommend creating models

### If Data is Missing:
- **Issue**: No cell line data in database
- **Action**: Check if migration scripts exist and document status

### If Performance is Poor:
- **Issue**: Queries take too long
- **Action**: Document performance issues and recommend database optimizations

### If JSON Structure is Wrong:
- **Issue**: JSON data doesn't match expected schema
- **Action**: Document schema issues and recommend data transformation

## Success Indicators

### ✅ Migration is Complete and Ready
- All cell line data is in database
- Performance is acceptable
- JSON structure matches expectations
- No blocking issues for Phase 1 development

### ⚠️ Migration has Issues but is Fixable
- Data exists but has problems (performance, structure, etc.)
- Clear path to resolution documented
- Timeline impact on Phase 1 estimated

### ❌ Migration is Not Complete
- No cell line data in database OR
- Fundamental structural problems OR
- Data integrity issues

## Getting Started

1. **Clone/Access Repository**: Ensure you have access to the project repository
2. **Set Up Environment**: Make sure you can run Django commands
3. **Access Database**: Verify you can connect to the database
4. **Start Investigation**: Begin with database structure examination
5. **Document Everything**: Record all findings as you go

## Questions or Concerns?

If you encounter any blockers or have questions about:
- Project structure or setup
- Database access issues
- Unclear requirements
- Technical problems

Document them in your report with as much detail as possible.

## Timeline

**Expected Completion**: 1 business day  
**Critical Path**: This task blocks all other Phase 1 development  
**Escalation**: If you cannot complete this task within 1 day, escalate immediately  

## Next Steps After Completion

Once you've verified the migration status:
1. Submit your Migration Status Report
2. If issues are found, work with the team to resolve them
3. If migration is complete, Phase 1 development can proceed with TASK-BE-1

---

**Remember**: This is a critical prerequisite task. The entire CellLineEditor Phase 1 timeline depends on having reliable, performant access to cell line data in the database. Take the time to thoroughly verify everything is working correctly.
