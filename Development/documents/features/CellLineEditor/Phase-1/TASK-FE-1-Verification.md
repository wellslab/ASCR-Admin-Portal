# TASK-FE-1-VERIFICATION: Custom Editor Implementation Assessment

**Task ID**: TASK-FE-1-VERIFICATION  
**Task Type**: Quality Assurance & Verification  
**Phase**: 1 (Core Editor)  
**Sprint**: 2 (Custom Editor Foundation)  
**Assignee**: QA Implementation Agent  
**Estimated Duration**: 0.5-1 day  
**Dependencies**: ‚úÖ TASK-FE-1 (Custom Editor Frontend Implementation - claimed complete)

## Task Overview

**Objective**: Conduct comprehensive verification of the TASK-FE-1 implementation and generate an official completion report for the Manager Agent. The original completion report was lost, but the implementation has been witnessed as functional.

**Scope**: Assess all 26 acceptance criteria from the original TASK-FE-1 assignment and document what was actually implemented, what works correctly, and what may need attention.

## Background Context

### Original TASK-FE-1 Requirements
Build a **custom pseudo-text-editor** component that displays cell line data in a clean, text-editor-like interface without exposing JSON syntax. This implements the core editor interface for Dr. Suzy Butcher's cell line editing workflow.

### Key Design Requirements
- Clean `field: value` display without JSON syntax
- Value-only editing (field names read-only)
- Collapsible sections for nested objects/arrays
- Text editor aesthetics with line numbers
- Real-time validation feedback

### Expected Implementation Location
```
src/app/tools/editor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx                    # Editor page route
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CustomCellLineEditor.tsx   # Main editor component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EditorLine.tsx             # Individual line component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InlineEditor.tsx           # Value editing component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ArrayEditor.tsx            # Array management component
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CollapsibleSection.tsx     # Expand/collapse component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useCellLineData.tsx        # Data fetching hook
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useSchemaData.tsx          # Schema fetching hook
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ editor.ts                  # TypeScript interfaces
```

## Verification Instructions

### Step 1: Environment Setup & Access
```bash
# Start the development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose logs frontend
docker-compose logs web

# Access the editor
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/tools/editor/{cellLineId}
# Test with existing cell line: AIBNi001-A
```

### Step 2: Code Structure Assessment
**Review the implemented file structure:**
- Does the file organization match the expected structure?
- Are the main components present and properly organized?
- Is TypeScript properly implemented with appropriate interfaces?

### Step 3: Functional Testing (26 Acceptance Criteria)

#### **Core Editor Display (5 criteria)**
Test each criterion systematically:

1. **JSON-to-lines parser** 
   - Load a cell line (e.g., AIBNi001-A)
   - Verify data appears as displayable lines
   - Check: Does complex nested JSON become readable lines?

2. **Line numbers**
   - Check: Do line numbers start from 1?
   - Check: Do they increment properly for each field?
   - Check: Are they visually consistent?

3. **Clean formatting**
   - Check: Shows `field: value` format?
   - Check: No JSON syntax visible (quotes, braces, commas)?
   - Check: Readable for non-technical users?

4. **Indentation**
   - Check: Nested objects properly indented?
   - Check: Hierarchy clearly visible?
   - Check: Consistent indentation levels?

5. **Monospace styling**

   - Try clicking field names - are they read-only?
   - Check: Clear distinction between editable/non-editable?

7. **Inline editors**
   - Test text fields, boolean fields, choice fields
   - Check: Appropriate editor type for each field?
   - Check: Schema integration working?

8. **Save on Enter/blur**

   - Edit a value, click away
   - Check: Do changes commit properly?

9. **Cancel on Escape**
   - Start editing, press Escape
   - Check: Changes discarded and original restored?

10. **Field validation**
    - Try invalid values (if validation rules exist)
    - Check: Error indicators (üî¥) appear inline?
    - Check: User-friendly error messages?

#### **Collapsible Sections (4 criteria)**

11. **Nested objects display**
    - Find nested objects in cell line data
    - Check: ‚ñº/‚ñ∂ arrows present?

12. **Click to collapse**
    - Click ‚ñº arrow
    - Check: Content hides and arrow becomes ‚ñ∂?

13. **Click to expand**
    - Click ‚ñ∂ arrow
    - Check: Content shows and arrow becomes ‚ñº?

14. **State persistence**
    - Collapse sections, edit other fields
    - Check: Collapse state maintained during editing?
