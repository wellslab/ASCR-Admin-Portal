- **Professional Appearance**: VS Code-inspired interface that feels familiar and trustworthy
- **Easy Navigation**: Collapsible sections organize complex nested data logically
- **Line Numbers**: Professional text-editor appearance with visual organization

**User Impact**: Dr. Suzy Butcher can now edit complex cell line records as easily as editing a document.

### **2. Modal Value Editing System** ‚ú®
**Challenge Solved**: Editing complex values within cramped inline spaces was error-prone and frustrating.

**Solution Delivered**:
- **Focused Editing**: Click any value to open a centered, distraction-free editing window
- **Smart Input Types**: Automatic selection of appropriate input controls (text boxes, dropdowns, etc.)
- **Simple Controls**: Just press Enter to save or Escape to cancel - no buttons needed
- **Field Context**: Always shows which field is being edited to prevent confusion

**User Impact**: Editing feels natural and error-free, with ample space for reviewing and modifying values.

### **3. Complete Array Management** üìã
**Challenge Solved**: Cell line records contain lists of related information (publications, ethics approvals, etc.) that were difficult to modify.

**Solution Delivered**:
- **Add Items**: Simple "+ Add Item" buttons to expand any list with new entries
- **Remove Items**: Clean removal of unwanted list entries
- **Smart Defaults**: New items are pre-structured with all required fields, ready for editing
- **Schema Integration**: System automatically knows what fields each new item should contain

**User Impact**: Dr. Suzy Butcher can easily manage publication lists, ethics approvals, and other array data without technical knowledge.

### **4. Advanced Safety Features** üõ°Ô∏è
**Challenge Solved**: Editing complex data carries risk of accidental changes or data loss.

**Solution Delivered**:
- **Undo Capability**: Step-by-step reversal of individual changes
- **Revert All**: Nuclear option to restore original state if needed
- **Change Tracking**: System remembers all modifications for safety
- **No Data Loss**: All changes are held safely until explicitly saved

**User Impact**: Confident editing with complete safety net - users can experiment without fear of breaking data.

### **5. Visual Excellence** üé®
**Challenge Solved**: Scientific tools often have poor user interfaces that feel outdated or intimidating.

**Solution Delivered**:
- **Professional Color Scheme**: Solarized theme reduces eye strain during extended editing
- **Type-Based Highlighting**: Different data types have distinct visual styling
- **Consistent Design**: All elements follow modern UI/UX best practices
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes

**User Impact**: A tool that scientists are proud to use and that supports productive, comfortable work sessions.
