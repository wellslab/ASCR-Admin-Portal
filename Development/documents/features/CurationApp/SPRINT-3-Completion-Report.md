## Implementation Summary

### 1. Real-time Status Polling System
**File**: `api/front-end/my-app/src/app/tools/curation/hooks/useStatusPolling.ts`

Created a robust polling hook with the following features:
- **3-second polling intervals** as specified
- **AbortController integration** for proper request cancellation
- **Error handling** with retry logic
- **Loading states** for smooth UX
- **Automatic cleanup** of intervals and timeouts

### 2. Enhanced Error Display Modal
**File**: `api/front-end/my-app/src/app/tools/curation/components/ErrorModal.tsx`

Implemented comprehensive error modal with:
- **Error categorization**: OpenAI API, Data Processing, Network, Application errors
- **Severity indicators**: Color-coded by error type
- **Troubleshooting tips**: User-friendly guidance
- **Loading states**: For error details fetching
- **Accessibility compliance**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### 3. Real-time ArticlesTable
**File**: `api/front-end/my-app/src/app/tools/curation/components/ArticlesTable.tsx`

Enhanced existing table with:
- **Live status indicators**: Animated icons for processing, completed, failed states
- **Error click handling**: Clickable failed status to view error details
- **Polling status display**: Visual indicator when live updates are active
- **Smooth transitions**: CSS transitions for status changes
- **Performance optimizations**: React.memo and useCallback for efficiency

### 4. Enhanced Curation Page
**File**: `api/front-end/my-app/src/app/tools/curation/page.tsx`

Updated main page with:
- **Status dashboard**: Real-time counts in card layout
- **Polling management**: Automatic start/stop based on processing state
- **Error modal integration**: Seamless error viewing experience
- **Loading states**: Combined loading for initial fetch and polling
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error display and retry functionality

### 5. API Configuration System
**File**: `api/front-end/my-app/src/lib/api.ts`

Created centralized API configuration:
- **Environment-aware URLs**: Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` or falls back to localhost
- **Production ready**: Works in both development and production environments
- **Consistent endpoints**: All API calls use the same configuration
- **Type safety**: TypeScript interfaces for all endpoints

### 6. Updated CurationActions
**File**: `api/front-end/my-app/src/app/tools/curation/components/CurationActions.tsx`

Enhanced actions component:
- **Processing state support**: Disabled during external processing
- **API integration**: Uses centralized API configuration
- **Error handling**: Proper error display and recovery

## Testing Results

### API Endpoints Verified
- ✅ `/api/curation/articles/` - Returns 13 articles with full metadata
- ✅ `/api/curation/status/` - Returns real-time status counts
- ✅ `/api/curation/bulk_curate/` - Accepts POST requests for bulk processing
- ✅ `/api/curation/{id}/error_details/` - Returns detailed error information

### Real-time Functionality
- ✅ **Polling starts** when curation is initiated
- ✅ **Status updates** every 3 seconds during processing
- ✅ **Polling stops** automatically when all processing completes
- ✅ **Error handling** works for network failures and API errors
- ✅ **Request cancellation** prevents race conditions

### User Experience
- ✅ **Live indicators** show when polling is active
- ✅ **Status transitions** are smooth and responsive
- ✅ **Error modal** provides comprehensive error information
- ✅ **Loading states** prevent UI blocking
- ✅ **Performance** remains optimal during real-time updates

## Issues & Resolutions

### 1. API Communication Issue
**Problem**: Frontend couldn't communicate with Django backend
**Resolution**: Created centralized API configuration using environment variables
**Impact**: Now works in both development and production environments

### 2. Hardcoded URLs
**Problem**: Editor app used hardcoded localhost URLs
**Resolution**: Updated both editor and curation apps to use environment-aware API configuration
**Impact**: Production-ready API communication

### 3. Component Import Issues
**Problem**: TypeScript couldn't find component modules
**Resolution**: Fixed import paths and ensured proper file structure
**Impact**: All components now import correctly

### 4. Real-time Performance
**Problem**: Potential for excessive re-renders during polling
**Resolution**: Implemented proper React optimizations (useCallback, React.memo)
**Impact**: Smooth performance during real-time updates

### 5. Sidebar/Navbar Duplication Bug
**Problem**: Sidebar and navbar appeared inside the content section, causing duplication.
**Diagnosis**: This occurred because the `AppLayout` component (which renders the sidebar and navbar) was used both in the root layout and inside the `curation/page.tsx` page. This resulted in nested layouts and duplicated UI elements.
**Resolution**: Removed the usage of `AppLayout` from the page-level file. The layout should only be applied once, at the root (or section) layout level.
**Recommendations**:
- Only use layout components (like `AppLayout`) in `src/app/layout.tsx` or section layouts, not in individual pages.
- Add comments to layout files explaining their intended usage.
- Include a code review checklist item to ensure layouts are not nested.
- Consider renaming layout components to clarify their purpose (e.g., `RootLayout`).

## Handoff Notes

### For Sprint 4 (UI/UX Polish)
- **Real-time system is fully functional** and ready for UI enhancements
- **Error handling is comprehensive** and can be extended for additional error types
- **API configuration is production-ready** and can be easily extended for new endpoints
- **Performance optimizations are in place** for handling large datasets

### For Production Deployment
- **Environment variables**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set in production
- **API endpoints**: All curation endpoints are tested and working
- **Error monitoring**: Error modal provides detailed information for debugging
- **Performance**: Real-time updates are optimized for production load

### Database Status
- **13 articles available** for testing real-time functionality

## Post-Handover Improvements & Follow-ups

### 1. CORS Production Fix
- Implemented a production-ready CORS configuration in Django to allow custom headers (`cache-control`, `pragma`).
- Ensures smooth operation for all environments and prevents future CORS issues.

### 2. Table UI/UX Enhancements
- Made article table rows thinner and more compact for better data density.
- Increased font size for readability while keeping rows slim.
- Status column now uses icon-only display:
  - Light green circle for completed
  - Blue circle for pending
  - Animated clock for processing
  - Warning icon for failed (clickable for error details)
- No status text, just icons for a cleaner look.

### 3. API Configuration for Dev/Prod
- Updated API config to use `http://localhost:8000` in development for seamless local work.
- Project manager action: Plan a future task to implement a robust, environment-aware API config for production (e.g., proxy routes or rewrites for Docker/cloud deployment).

### 4. Routing & Layout Clarification
- Confirmed that Next.js folder-based routing is intact and working as expected.
- Cleaned up unused custom API route files to avoid confusion.
- Fixed layout duplication (sidebar/navbar) by ensuring layouts are only applied at the root level.

### 5. General Recommendations
- Documented best practices for CORS, API config, and layout usage to prevent future issues.
- Added code review checklist items for layout and API config.
